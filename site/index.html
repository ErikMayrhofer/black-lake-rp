    <p class="card">
        Black Lake is a Mystery-Live-Roleplay which resembles or parodies (depends on how you play it)
        cliche American Horror Movies. A group of (young?) people go on holiday in a remote area. But suddenly
        something goes wrong and people start dying. There is a murderer within the group. Will the survivors identify
        him in time or will the evil prevail?
    </p>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <div  class="card">
    <p>The game is played during a vacation, at any time and alongside the normal everyday activities.</p>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <p>A lot depends on roleplaying. It's not about winning, it's about writing and living an exciting story.
        You start by anonymously selecting a murderer by drawing cards or in some other way. It's recommended that
        you do this some time before the actual vacation, so that the murderer can prepare and plan. Then the murderer
        is advised to write several murder-cards (or print and laminate them if you want to go fancy). These cards
        are simple small paper strips with texts like: <span class="mono">I slit your throat with something sharp. You may scream.</span>
        To make the game more fun he can also print out some threats or clues that he can hide somewhere during the
        game.</p>
    <h3>Game</h3>
    <h4>Murder</h4>
    <p>The players are strongly advised to stay in their roles the whole time. That means not mentioning the game and
        not doing anything that american-horror-teens would not do - For example staying calm and acting in a sane way.
        The murderer patiently waits for opportunities where he can sneak up to a friend and kill him - best without
        being seen.
        This can be done by acting out the whole murder sequence (e.g using the finger as a knife and play like you are
        slitting a throat)
        or simply by saying "Hello, I am the murderer" and then explaining how you are killing him. In this process you
        hand
        over the murder-card.</p>
    <h4>Poison</h4>
    <p>Of course such murder-cards can also be hidden in food or tea, in which case the first person to find them will
        keep the card and then play like being poisoned (or whatever creative way the murderer found to kill
        people).</p>
    <h4>Discovery</h4>
    <p>When someone dies he should stay where he died - or tell the others that his dead body can be found 'over
        there'.
        Then the dead person describes the crime scene as good as possible. He can be creative and invent some things,
        but
        the most important thing is to describe wounds and possible evidence. Dead people obviously obtain information
        which their in-game characters would have never had and are advised to keep them confident.</p>
    <h3>Winning the Game</h3>
    <p>No. There is no such thing as 'winning' the game. In Horror-Movies everyone dies. And so should it be in this
        game.
        The fun is in playing, and creating a detailed and exciting story. This is also the reason why the victims have
        no real way to defend - because this is not a competitive game. As soon as any player disrespects this rule
        all fun is lost. Dying is not a punishment, it is an opportunity to shape the world and give the survivors
        something
        to think about - some hidden clues in the crime scene, or a dramatic realisation to be had.</p>

    <h2>Pay attention!</h2>
    <p class="card">Please! Stay! Safe! There is no need in using actual knifes for playing murder scenes or becoming violent.
        The group must discuss rules and how far the roleplaying should go in advance. These rules are no actual
        game-rules,
        just some rules that we made up to spice up our holidays and must be adapted for every group that plays. So
        talk to your friends and create something new!</p>
